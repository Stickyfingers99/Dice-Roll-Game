🎲 Game Rules
• The game is for 2 players.
• Players take turns to roll a dice.
• On each turn, a player can roll as many times as they want and keep adding the dice value to their current score for that turn.
• BUT! If they roll a 1, they lose all points collected in that turn and their turn ends.
• A player can choose to “hold” at any time to add the current turn’s points to their total score and pass the dice to the other player.
• The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.
